If using VSCode: 
* make sure ethers are not auto-imported into solidity contract
* imports might be unresolved if the compiler isn't globally installed on your system

### HardHat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
## Testing
1. Deploy contract to Rinkeby Testnet to validate: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby`
2. Check contract address on [Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/) 


### Tools
* Rinkeby testnet
* Metamask wallet
